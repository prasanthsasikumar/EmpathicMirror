**Empathic Mirror**

*MagicMirror²* is an open source modular smart mirror platform. With a growing list of installable modules, which allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant. Magic Mirror is built by the creator of [the original MagicMirror](https://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror) with the incredible help of a [growing community of contributors](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/graphs/contributors).

MagicMirror² focuses on a modular plugin system and uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) as an application wrapper. So no more web server or browser installs necessary!
