## Empathic Mirror

**Empathic Mirror** is an open source modular smart mirror platform with a focus on remote collaboration and personal assistance. Empathic Mirror is forked from the parent project *Magic Mirror* which is an open source modular smart mirror platform with a growing list of installable modules. Allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant. Magic Mirror is built by the creator of [the original MagicMirror](https://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror) with the incredible help of a [growing community of contributors](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/graphs/contributors). Focuses on a modular plugin system and uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) as an application wrapper. So no more web server or browser installs necessary!
